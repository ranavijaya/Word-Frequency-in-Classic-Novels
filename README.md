# Word Frequency in Classic Novels

Use web scraping and NLP to find the most frequent words in one of two pieces of classic literature: Herman Melville&#39;s novel, Moby Dick, or Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie

Project Description

In this Project, we scrape a novel from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package  **requests**. Then we extract words from this web data using  **BeautifulSoup****. **Finally, we dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit** ( ****nltk**** ).**

The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world&#39;s data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.
